# phylogenetics
This repository contains the code for the phylogenetics project "Geometry of symmetric gropu-based models" by Dimitra Kosta and Kaie Kubjas.

The first part of file "algorithm.m2" contains Macaulay2 code for Algorithm 2 applied to Example 5 in the paper. Moreover it constructs likelihood ideals for each of the boundary components. At the end of the file it is shown how to use numerical algebraic geometry to find the solutions of a likelihood ideal.

The code that completes all the steps of Algorithm 1 and 2 will be available in the Bachelor thesis of Aki Malinen.
